[http://www.julialang.org](Julia) is an open-source alternative to MATLAB for scientific computing.
It is hyper-optimized for numerical software development: the language is expressive, powerful, fast, and accompanied by extensive libraries.
But it is also a fully capable general purpose programming language in the Unix tradition.

I'm learning Julia in conjunction with advanced work in numerical analysis related to my Ph.D. thesis in Applied Mathematics.
