[Julia](http://www.julialang.org) is a programming language for scientific computing.
It might be characterized in many ways.
From my perspective, it is an open-source alternative to MATLAB, with greater capabilities for general purpose programming.

I'm learning Julia in conjunction with thesis work in numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra in particular.
